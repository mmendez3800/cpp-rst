# C++ Randomized Search Tree
This project implements a randomized search tree data structure using C++ and performs multiple tests on the structure

## General Info
The followign tests are performed to check the methods implemented in the `*.hpp` files:
 * Inserts random nodes into the tree
 * Traverses through the tree after a left rotation
 * Traverses through the tree after a right rotation
 * Inserts ordered nodes into the tree
 * Traverses through the order of the
